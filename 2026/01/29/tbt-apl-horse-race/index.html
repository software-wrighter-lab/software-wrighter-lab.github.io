This is the first Throwback Thursday post—a series where I revisit the technologies, languages, and ideas that shaped how I think about programming. Resource Link Code apl-horse-race Demo Live Demo GNU APL gnu.org/software/apl Video Greek Code, No Lowercase #TBT APL: A Programming Language APL was created by Kenneth Iverson at IBM in the 1960s. The name literally means “A Programming Language”—Iverson was a mathematician who designed it as a notation for describing algorithms before it became an actual programming language. What made APL special: Feature Description Array-oriented Operations work on entire arrays, not single values Symbolic notation Greek letters and mathematical symbols as operators Interactive REPL-style development decades before it was common Terse Complex operations in a few characters APL programs look like nothing else: POS←POS+?5⍴3 This single line adds random values (1-3) to all five horse positions simultaneously. No loops. No iteration. The operation just happens across the entire array. The IBM 2741 Experience In 1972, APL\360 ran on IBM mainframes. You accessed it through terminals like the IBM 2741—essentially a modified Selectric typewriter with a special APL typeball. APL typeball for IBM Selectric The typeball had all the APL glyphs: ⍴ ⍳ ∇ ⎕ ← ⌈ ⌊ ⍵ ⍺ ∘ ⊃ ⊂ and dozens more. You physically typed these symbols. The keyboard layout was completely different from anything you’d seen before. When you made an error, there was no backspace in the modern sense. You’d overstrike characters or start the line over. Programs were stored in workspaces, saved to tape or disk. The terminal printed on paper. Every interaction left a physical record. The Horse Race Program Horse race simulations were popular APL demonstrations. They showed off several things: Random number generation (? roll operator) Array operations (updating all positions at once) Character graphics (crude but effective visualization) Interactive output (watching the race unfold) Here’s the verbose version from the repo: ∇ RACE;HORSES;POS;FINISH;ROUND;_ HORSES←&#39;LUCKY &#39; &#39;THUNDER&#39; &#39;SHADOW &#39; &#39;COMET &#39; &#39;BLAZE &#39; POS←5⍴0 FINISH←15 ROUND←0 ⎕←&#39;══════════════════════════════════════════&#39; ⎕←&#39; THE RACE IS ON!&#39; ⎕←&#39;══════════════════════════════════════════&#39; LOOP:ROUND←ROUND+1 ⎕←&#39;--- ROUND &#39;,(⍕ROUND),&#39; ---&#39; POS←POS+?5⍴3 SHOWHORSES →DONE×⍳∨/POS≥FINISH →LOOP DONE:⎕←&#39;WINNER: &#39;,((⊃(POS=⌈/POS)/⍳5)⊃HORSES),&#39;!&#39; ∇ Key APL Idioms Array creation: POS←5⍴0 ⍝ Create array of 5 zeros The ⍴ (rho) operator reshapes. 5⍴0 means “reshape 0 into a 5-element array.” Random numbers: ?5⍴3 ⍝ Roll 5 dice, each 1-3 The ? operator is “roll”—like rolling dice. ?5⍴3 rolls five 3-sided dice.

What APL Taught Me APL shaped how I think about programming in ways that persist today: 1. Think in arrays, not loops. When I see a problem, I ask: can this be expressed as an operation on a whole collection? Languages like NumPy, R, and Julia carry this forward. 2. Notation matters. Good notation can make complex ideas simple. Bad notation obscures them. APL’s symbols were controversial, but they made array operations visible in ways that verbose syntax doesn’t. 3. The REPL is powerful. Interactive development—type an expression, see the result immediately—was central to APL decades before it became fashionable again with Jupyter notebooks and modern REPLs. 4. Terseness has value. Not obfuscation for its own sake, but the ability to see an entire algorithm at once. When your program fits on one screen, you can reason about the whole thing.

<h2 id="apl-a-programming-language">APL: A Programming Language</h2>

<p>APL was created by Kenneth Iverson at IBM in the 1960s. The name literally means “A Programming Language”—Iverson was a mathematician who designed it as a notation for describing algorithms before it became an actual programming language.</p>

<p>What made APL special:</p>

<table>

      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Array-oriented</strong></td>
      <td>Operations work on entire arrays, not single values</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Symbolic notation</strong></td>
      <td>Greek letters and mathematical symbols as operators</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Interactive</strong></td>
      <td>REPL-style development decades before it was common</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Terse</strong></td>
      <td>Complex operations in a few characters</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>APL programs look like nothing else:</p>

<pre><code class="language-apl">POS←POS+?5⍴3
</code></pre>

<p>This single line adds random values (1-3) to all five horse positions simultaneously. No loops. No iteration. The operation just <em>happens</em> across the entire array.</p>

<h2 id="the-ibm-2741-experience">The IBM 2741 Experience</h2>

<p>In 1972, APL\360 ran on IBM mainframes. You accessed it through terminals like the IBM 2741—essentially a modified Selectric typewriter with a special APL typeball.</p>

<figure class="inline-right">
  <img src="/assets/images/posts/2026-01-29-apl/selectric-typeball.png" alt="IBM Selectric APL typeball" width="200" />
  <figcaption>APL typeball for IBM Selectric</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The typeball had all the APL glyphs: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">⍴ ⍳ ∇ ⎕ ← ⌈ ⌊ ⍵ ⍺ ∘ ⊃ ⊂</code> and dozens more. You physically typed these symbols. The keyboard layout was completely different from anything you’d seen before.</p>

<p>When you made an error, there was no backspace in the modern sense. You’d overstrike characters or start the line over. Programs were stored in workspaces, saved to tape or disk.</p>

<p>The terminal printed on paper. Every interaction left a physical record.</p>

<h2 id="the-horse-race-program">The Horse Race Program</h2>

<p>Horse race simulations were popular APL demonstrations. They showed off several things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Random number generation</strong> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> roll operator)</li>
  <li><strong>Array operations</strong> (updating all positions at once)</li>
  <li><strong>Character graphics</strong> (crude but effective visualization)</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive output</strong> (watching the race unfold)</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s the verbose version from the repo:</p>

<pre><code class="language-apl">∇ RACE;HORSES;POS;FINISH;ROUND;_
  HORSES←'LUCKY  ' 'THUNDER' 'SHADOW ' 'COMET  ' 'BLAZE  '
  POS←5⍴0
  FINISH←15
  ROUND←0
  ⎕←'══════════════════════════════════════════'
  ⎕←'           THE RACE IS ON!'
  ⎕←'══════════════════════════════════════════'
LOOP:ROUND←ROUND+1
  ⎕←'--- ROUND ',(⍕ROUND),' ---'
  POS←POS+?5⍴3
  SHOWHORSES
  →DONE×⍳∨/POS≥FINISH
  →LOOP
DONE:⎕←'WINNER: ',((⊃(POS=⌈/POS)/⍳5)⊃HORSES),'!'
∇
</code></pre>

<h3 id="key-apl-idioms">Key APL Idioms</h3>

<p><strong>Array creation:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-apl">POS←5⍴0    ⍝ Create array of 5 zeros
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">⍴</code> (rho) operator reshapes. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5⍴0</code> means “reshape 0 into a 5-element array.”</p>

<p><strong>Random numbers:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-apl">?5⍴3       ⍝ Roll 5 dice, each 1-3
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> operator is “roll”—like rolling dice. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?5⍴3</code> rolls five 3-sided dice.</p>

<p><strong>Finding the winner:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-apl">(⊃(POS=⌈/POS)/⍳5)⊃HORSES
</code></pre>

<p>This reads right-to-left:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">⌈/POS</code> — maximum of all positions</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POS=⌈/POS</code> — boolean mask: which horses are at max?</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/⍳5</code> — compress: keep only those indices</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">⊃</code> — take the first one</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">⊃HORSES</code> — select that horse’s name</li>
</ul>

<p>One line. No loops. Pure array thinking.</p>

<h2 id="the-idiomatic-version">The Idiomatic Version</h2>

<p>APL programmers pride themselves on terseness. The idiomatic version does the same thing in fewer characters:</p>

<pre><code class="language-apl">HORSES←'LUCKY  ' 'THUNDER' 'SHADOW ' 'COMET  ' 'BLAZE  '

∇ SHOW;I
  I←1
N:⎕←(I⊃HORSES),'│',((I⊃POS)⍴'░'),'▓'
  I←I+1
  →N×⍳I≤5
∇

∇ RACE;POS;_
  POS←5⍴0
  ⎕←'THE RACE IS ON!'
L:_←⎕DL 0.3
  POS←POS+?5⍴3
  SHOW
  ⎕←''
  →L×⍳~∨/POS≥15
  ⎕←'WINNER: ',(⊃(POS=⌈/POS)/⍳5)⊃HORSES
∇
</code></pre>

<p>The entire program fits on a single screen. This was the APL aesthetic: powerful ideas expressed concisely.</p>

<h2 id="running-it-today">Running It Today</h2>

<p>GNU APL implements ISO 13751 (Extended APL) and runs on modern systems:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># macOS</span>
brew <span class="nb">install </span>gnu-apl

<span class="c"># Arch Linux</span>
yay <span class="nt">-S</span> gnu-apl

<span class="c"># Run the race</span>
git clone https://github.com/sw-comp-history/apl-horse-race
<span class="nb">cd </span>apl-horse-race
apl <span class="nt">-f</span> src/race.apl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Sample output:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>══════════════════════════════════════════
           THE RACE IS ON!
══════════════════════════════════════════

--- ROUND 1 ---
LUCKY   │▓▓▓◄
THUNDER │▓▓◄
SHADOW  │▓◄
COMET   │▓▓▓◄
BLAZE   │▓▓◄
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The horses advance randomly until one crosses the finish line.</p>

<h2 id="what-apl-taught-me">What APL Taught Me</h2>

<p>APL shaped how I think about programming in ways that persist today:</p>

<p><strong>1. Think in arrays, not loops.</strong></p>

<p>When I see a problem, I ask: can this be expressed as an operation on a whole collection? Languages like NumPy, R, and Julia carry this forward.</p>

<p><strong>2. Notation matters.</strong></p>

<p>Good notation can make complex ideas simple. Bad notation obscures them. APL’s symbols were controversial, but they made array operations <em>visible</em> in ways that verbose syntax doesn’t.</p>

<p><strong>3. The REPL is powerful.</strong></p>

<p>Interactive development—type an expression, see the result immediately—was central to APL decades before it became fashionable again with Jupyter notebooks and modern REPLs.</p>

<p><strong>4. Terseness has value.</strong></p>

<p>Not obfuscation for its own sake, but the ability to see an entire algorithm at once. When your program fits on one screen, you can reason about the whole thing.</p>

<h2 id="apls-legacy">APL’s Legacy</h2>

<p><strong>Good for you if:</strong> You want to understand array programming origins, learn basic APL, or experience what programming felt like in the 1970s.</p>

<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> Low. The program is intentionally simple—a teaching example, not production code. The repo includes extensive documentation explaining every line.</p>

<h2 id="why-throwback-thursday">Why Throwback Thursday?</h2>

<p>Programming didn’t start with Python and JavaScript. Every abstraction we use today was invented by someone solving a real problem.</p>

<p>TBT posts will explore:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Languages that shaped my thinking (APL, Lisp, Forth)</li>
  <li>Technologies that were ahead of their time (CMS/TSO Pipelines, dataflow)</li>
  <li>Ideas worth revisiting with modern tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding where we came from helps us see where we’re going.</p>
