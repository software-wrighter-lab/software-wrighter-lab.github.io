<meta name="description" content="I needed to find cat photos scattered across my system. Instead of searching the app store, signing up for a cloud service, or uploading my personal photos to someone else’s servers, I asked Claude Code to build me the tool I needed. An hour later, I had it. This is Personal Software—software that exists because you needed it, built the way you want it, running entirely under your control. Resource Link Repo cat-finder Video Cat Finder Explainer The Vibe Coding Approach Vibe Coding is about describing what you want and letting AI handle the implementation details. No boilerplate, no Stack Overflow rabbit holes, no fighting with build systems. You focus on the what, the AI handles the how. For Cat Finder, the conversation went something like: “I want a CLI tool that scans directories for images containing cats. Run locally, no cloud. Use YOLO for detection. Output just the file paths so I can pipe them to other commands.” Claude Code chose the tech stack (Rust, YOLOv8n, ONNX Runtime), handled the tensor math, figured out the COCO class IDs, and produced a working tool. I guided the direction; the AI wrote the code. Why Personal Software? The traditional options for “find cat photos” would be: Cloud service: Upload photos to Google/Apple/Amazon, let them scan everything, hope they respect your privacy Desktop app: Find something in an app store, hope it does what you want, deal with subscription fees or ads Write it yourself: Spend days learning YOLO integration, tensor formats, image preprocessing Personal Software offers a fourth path: describe what you need, get exactly that, own the result completely. Cat Finder runs entirely on my machine. No accounts, no uploads, no subscriptions, no ads. The code is mine to modify, extend, or share. What Got Built A Rust CLI tool using YOLOv8n (the nano variant) through ONNX Runtime: Directory Traversal → Image Preprocessing → YOLO Inference → Cat Detection → Output The Detection Pipeline Walk directories recursively, finding image files (jpg, png, gif, webp, etc.) Preprocess each image: resize to 640×640, normalize to 0.0-1.0, convert to NCHW tensor format Run inference through the YOLOv8n ONNX model Parse output for class ID 15 (cat in COCO ordering) above confidence threshold Print matching paths to stdout for easy piping to other tools Unix Philosophy # stdout: just paths (machine-parseable) # stderr: logging and progress cat-finder ~/Photos | xargs -I {} cp {} ~/CatPhotos/ This separation enables composable Unix pipelines. The tool does one thing well and plays nicely with others. Technology Stack Component Purpose Rust Memory-safe, high-performance core YOLOv8n Lightweight object detection (12MB model) ONNX Runtime Cross-platform inference engine clap CLI argument parsing ndarray Tensor operations walkdir Recursive directory traversal Total footprint: ~80MB (runtime + model + binary) I didn’t choose this stack—Claude Code did, based on the requirements. It made good choices. Usage # Basic usage cat-finder ~/Photos # Adjust confidence threshold cat-finder --confidence 0.5 ~/Photos # Verbose output with timestamps cat-finder -v -t ~/Photos # Copy all cat photos to a new folder cat-finder ~/Photos | xargs -I {} cp {} ~/CatAlbum/ Honest About Limitations The README documents failure cases transparently: Image Type Detection Success Clear photographs High Artistic/stylized images Low Cats in clothing Low Small/partial cats Variable Low quality/blurry Variable Test results: 7 of 9 cat images detected (77.8% recall). Oil paintings and anthropomorphized cats confuse models trained on photographs. This is documented, not hidden. Bonus Features The project grew organically based on related needs: Duplicate Finder: A second binary for finding duplicate images using size-based filtering followed by SHA-256 checksums. find-duplicates ~/Photos Web Demo: A Flask-based interface for visual feedback with real-time progress via Server-Sent Events.

<p>I needed to find cat photos scattered across my system. Instead of searching the app store, signing up for a cloud service, or uploading my personal photos to someone else’s servers, I asked Claude Code to build me the tool I needed. An hour later, I had it.</p>

<p>This is <strong>Personal Software</strong>—software that exists because you needed it, built the way you want it, running entirely under your control.</p>

<h2 id="the-vibe-coding-approach">The Vibe Coding Approach</h2>

<p><strong>Vibe Coding</strong> is about describing what you want and letting AI handle the implementation details. No boilerplate, no Stack Overflow rabbit holes, no fighting with build systems. You focus on the <em>what</em>, the AI handles the <em>how</em>.</p>

<p>For Cat Finder, the conversation went something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I want a CLI tool that scans directories for images containing cats. Run locally, no cloud. Use YOLO for detection. Output just the file paths so I can pipe them to other commands.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claude Code chose the tech stack (Rust, YOLOv8n, ONNX Runtime), handled the tensor math, figured out the COCO class IDs, and produced a working tool. I guided the direction; the AI wrote the code.</p>

<h2 id="why-personal-software">Why Personal Software?</h2>

<p>The traditional options for “find cat photos” would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cloud service</strong>: Upload photos to Google/Apple/Amazon, let them scan everything, hope they respect your privacy</li>
  <li><strong>Desktop app</strong>: Find something in an app store, hope it does what you want, deal with subscription fees or ads</li>
  <li><strong>Write it yourself</strong>: Spend days learning YOLO integration, tensor formats, image preprocessing</li>
</ol>

<p>Personal Software offers a fourth path: <strong>describe what you need, get exactly that, own the result completely</strong>.</p>

<p>Cat Finder runs entirely on my machine. No accounts, no uploads, no subscriptions, no ads. The code is mine to modify, extend, or share.</p>

<h2 id="what-got-built">What Got Built</h2>

<p>A Rust CLI tool using <strong>YOLOv8n</strong> (the nano variant) through <strong>ONNX Runtime</strong>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Directory Traversal → Image Preprocessing → YOLO Inference → Cat Detection → Output
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-detection-pipeline">The Detection Pipeline</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Walk directories</strong> recursively, finding image files (jpg, png, gif, webp, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Preprocess each image</strong>: resize to 640×640, normalize to 0.0-1.0, convert to NCHW tensor format</li>
  <li><strong>Run inference</strong> through the YOLOv8n ONNX model</li>
  <li><strong>Parse output</strong> for class ID 15 (cat in COCO ordering) above confidence threshold</li>
  <li><strong>Print matching paths</strong> to stdout for easy piping to other tools</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="unix-philosophy">Unix Philosophy</h3>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># stdout: just paths (machine-parseable)</span>
<span class="c"># stderr: logging and progress</span>

cat-finder ~/Photos | xargs <span class="nt">-I</span> <span class="o">{}</span> <span class="nb">cp</span> <span class="o">{}</span> ~/CatPhotos/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This separation enables composable Unix pipelines. The tool does one thing well and plays nicely with others.</p>

<p>Test results: 7 of 9 cat images detected (77.8% recall). Oil paintings and anthropomorphized cats confuse models trained on photographs. This is documented, not hidden.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-features">Bonus Features</h2>

<p>The project grew organically based on related needs:</p>

<p><strong>Duplicate Finder</strong>: A second binary for finding duplicate images using size-based filtering followed by SHA-256 checksums.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>find-duplicates ~/Photos
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Web Demo</strong>: A Flask-based interface for visual feedback with real-time progress via Server-Sent Events.</p>

<p>These emerged from “while you’re at it…” requests during development. Vibe coding makes feature additions nearly frictionless.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/sw-ml-study/cat-finder

<h2 id="the-personal-software-philosophy">The Personal Software Philosophy</h2>

<p><strong>Privacy-first</strong>: All processing happens locally. No cloud APIs, no external services, no data leaving your machine.</p>

<p><strong>Fit-for-purpose</strong>: Built for exactly what you need, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Known limitations documented. No marketing spin.</p>
