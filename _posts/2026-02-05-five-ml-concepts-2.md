## Today's Five

### 1. Gradient Descent

**A general optimization method used across machine learning.** It improves a model by taking small steps in the direction that reduces error the most.

Many learning algorithms rely on it, especially neural networks.

> Like walking downhill in fog, adjusting each step based on the slope beneath your feet.

### 2. Attention

**A mechanism that lets models weigh different parts of the input by importance.** Instead of treating everything equally, attention highlights what matters most.

This was key to breakthroughs in translation and language models.

> Like reading a sentence and focusing more on the important words.

### 3. DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)

**A method for aligning language models with human preferences.** Unlike RLHF, it trains directly on preference comparisons and avoids an explicit reward model.

This simplifies training while achieving comparable alignment.

> Like learning preferences by observing choices, not by designing a scoring system.

### 4. Learning Rate

**Controls how large each update step is during training.** Too large and learning becomes unstable. Too small and training is slow or gets stuck.

One of the most important hyperparameters to tune.

> Like choosing how fast to walk downhill without losing balance.

### 5. Temperature

**A parameter that controls randomness during text generation.** Low temperature favors predictable, high-probability outputs. Higher temperature increases variety and surprise.

A tradeoff between consistency and creativity.

> Like adjusting a dial from cautious to adventurous.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Gradient Descent** | Walk downhill to minimize error |
| **Attention** | Focus on what matters in the input |
| **DPO** | Align models from preference pairs directly |
| **Learning Rate** | Step size that balances speed and stability |
| **Temperature** | Dial between predictable and creative |
