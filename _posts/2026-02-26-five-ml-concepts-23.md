## Today's Five

### 1. Emergent Behavior

**Some capabilities appear only when models reach sufficient scale.** These behaviors were not directly programmed but arise from learned representations.

Emergence is a key phenomenon in large language models.

> Like a child learning words and then suddenly understanding full sentences.

### 2. Tool Use

**Modern AI systems can generate structured commands to call external tools.** These include search engines, calculators, or code interpreters.

This extends model capabilities beyond internal knowledge.

> Like asking a librarian to look something up instead of guessing.

### 3. Loss Surface Sharpness

**Sharp minima are sensitive to small weight changes.** Flatter minima tend to be more robust and often generalize better.

Training methods that find flatter regions can improve test performance.

> Like standing on a plateau instead of balancing on a narrow peak.

### 4. Learning Rate Schedules

**Instead of keeping the learning rate constant, training often starts high and gradually reduces it.** Schedules like step decay or cosine annealing improve convergence.

Warm restarts can help escape local minima.

> Like running fast at first, then slowing down to finish precisely.

### 5. Canary Deployment

**A new model version is rolled out to a small percentage of users first.** If problems appear, rollout stops before affecting everyone.

Essential MLOps practice for safe production updates.

> Like tasting food before serving it to all your guests.
