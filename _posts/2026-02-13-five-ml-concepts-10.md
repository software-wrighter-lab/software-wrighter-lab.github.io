## Today's Five

### 1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

**Networks designed for image data that use small filters sliding across an image to detect edges, textures, and shapes.** Early layers find simple patterns, while deeper layers recognize complex objects.

CNNs are a foundation of modern computer vision.

> Like scanning a photo with a magnifying glass that learns to recognize patterns at different scales.

### 2. Encoder-Decoder

**A model architecture with two parts: the encoder compresses input into a representation, and the decoder generates an output from that representation.** This pattern is common in translation, summarization, and speech systems.

The representation acts as a bottleneck that captures essential information.

> Like summarizing a book into notes, then writing a new version from those notes.

### 3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Instead of relying only on learned parameters, the model retrieves relevant documents and uses them during generation.** This helps ground responses in external information and can reduce hallucinations.

RAG combines the strengths of retrieval systems and generative models.

> Like an open-book exam where you can look up facts instead of relying purely on memory.

### 4. Few-shot Learning

**Adapting behavior from just a few examples provided directly in the prompt.** Instead of retraining, the model infers the pattern and applies it to new inputs.

Zero-shot learning relies only on instructions, without examples.

> Like learning a card game by watching a few hands before playing.

### 5. Distillation

**Transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student.** The student learns to match the teacher's outputs, not its internal weights.

This produces models that are smaller and cheaper while retaining much of the original capability.

> Like an apprentice learning by imitating a master's finished work, not by copying their brain.

## Quick Reference
