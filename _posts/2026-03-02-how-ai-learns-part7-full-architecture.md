A robust continuous learning agent contains:

- **Core model** (rarely updated)
- **Adapters** (modular skills)
- **External memory** (facts)
- **Context manager** (Recursive Language Model (RLM)-style)
- **Logging & evaluation loop**

## Layer by Layer

### Layer 4: Core Weights (Bottom)

The foundation. Trained once, changed rarely.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Contains** | General reasoning, language, base knowledge |
| **Update frequency** | Months or never |
| **Update method** | Full fine-tune or major consolidation |
| **Risk of change** | High (forgetting, capability shifts) |

**Rule:** Don't touch this unless you have a very good reason.

### Layer 3: Adapters (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) / Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA))

Modular skills that plug into the base.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Contains** | Task-specific capabilities |
| **Update frequency** | Weekly to monthly |
| **Update method** | Lightweight PEFT training |
| **Risk of change** | Medium (isolated, but validate) |

**Rule:** Train adapters for validated, recurring patterns. Version them. Enable rollback.

### Layer 2: External Memory

Facts, experiences, and retrieved knowledge.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Contains** | Documents, logs, structured data |
| **Update frequency** | Continuous |
| **Update method** | Database writes |
| **Risk of change** | Low (doesn't affect weights) |

**Rule:** Store experiences here first. Memory is cheap and safe.

### Layer 1: Context Manager (Top)

The RLM-style interface that rebuilds focus each step.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Contains** | Current context, retrieved data, active state |
| **Update frequency** | Per call |
| **Update method** | Reconstruction from memory + query |
| **Risk of change** | None (ephemeral) |

**Rule:** Don't drag context forward. Rebuild it.

## The Feedback Loop

### Logging

Capture everything the agent does:
- Prompts received
- Actions taken
- Tool calls made
- Errors encountered
- User signals

This is your training data.

### Evaluation

Before any update reaches production:

| Check | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Retention tests** | Did old skills degrade? |
| **Forward transfer** | Did new skills improve? |
| **Regression suite** | Known failure cases |
| **Safety checks** | Harmful outputs? |

Without evaluation, you're updating blind.

### Deployment

Updates should be:
- **Modular:** Can isolate and rollback
- **Versioned:** Know what changed when
- **Staged:** Test before full rollout
- **Monitored:** Track post-deployment metrics

## The Error Flow

Where do errors go?

```
Error occurs
    ↓
Log it (immediate)
    ↓
Store in memory (same day)
    ↓
Pattern emerges over multiple occurrences
    ↓
Train adapter update (weekly/monthly)
    ↓
Validate update (before deployment)
    ↓
Deploy with rollback capability
```

Errors feed into memory first. Only validated, recurring improvements reach adapters. Core weights almost never change.

## What This Architecture Achieves

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Catastrophic forgetting** | Core weights frozen; adapters isolated |
| **Context rot** | RLM rebuilds focus each step |
| **Hallucination** | Memory grounds responses |
| **Slow adaptation** | Memory updates continuously |
| **Unsafe changes** | Evaluation before deployment |

## Design Principles

### 1. Separate Storage from Reasoning

Facts belong in memory. Reasoning belongs in weights. Don't blur them.

### 2. Separate Speed from Permanence

Fast learning (memory) is temporary. Slow learning (weights) is permanent. Match the update speed to the desired permanence.

### 3. Evaluate Before Consolidating

Every update to adapters or weights must be validated. Regressions are silent killers.

### 4. Enable Rollback

Version everything. If an update causes problems, you must be able to undo it.

### 5. Log Everything

You cannot improve what you cannot measure. Structured logging is the foundation of continuous learning.

## The Big Picture

AI does not learn in one place.

It learns in layers:
- **Permanent** (weights)
- **Modular** (adapters)
- **External** (memory)
- **Temporary** (context)

Continuous learning is not constant weight updates.

It is careful coordination across time scales.

> **Continuous learning systems don't constantly retrain. They carefully consolidate what works.**
