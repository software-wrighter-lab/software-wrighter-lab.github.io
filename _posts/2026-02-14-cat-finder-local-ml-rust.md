I needed to find cat photos scattered across my system. Instead of searching the app store, signing up for a cloud service, or uploading my personal photos to someone else's servers, I asked Claude Code to build me the tool I needed. An hour later, I had it.

This is **Personal Software**---software that exists because you needed it, built the way you want it, running entirely under your control.

## The Vibe Coding Approach

**Vibe Coding** is about describing what you want and letting AI handle the implementation details. No boilerplate, no Stack Overflow rabbit holes, no fighting with build systems. You focus on the *what*, the AI handles the *how*.

For Cat Finder, the conversation went something like:

> "I want a CLI tool that scans directories for images containing cats. Run locally, no cloud. Use YOLO for detection. Output just the file paths so I can pipe them to other commands."

Claude Code chose the tech stack (Rust, YOLOv8n, ONNX Runtime), handled the tensor math, figured out the COCO class IDs, and produced a working tool. I guided the direction; the AI wrote the code.

## Why Personal Software?

The traditional options for "find cat photos" would be:

1. **Cloud service**: Upload photos to Google/Apple/Amazon, let them scan everything, hope they respect your privacy
2. **Desktop app**: Find something in an app store, hope it does what you want, deal with subscription fees or ads
3. **Write it yourself**: Spend days learning YOLO integration, tensor formats, image preprocessing

Personal Software offers a fourth path: **describe what you need, get exactly that, own the result completely**.

Cat Finder runs entirely on my machine. No accounts, no uploads, no subscriptions, no ads. The code is mine to modify, extend, or share.

## What Got Built

A Rust CLI tool using **YOLOv8n** (the nano variant) through **ONNX Runtime**:

```
Directory Traversal → Image Preprocessing → YOLO Inference → Cat Detection → Output
```

### The Detection Pipeline

1. **Walk directories** recursively, finding image files (jpg, png, gif, webp, etc.)
2. **Preprocess each image**: resize to 640×640, normalize to 0.0-1.0, convert to NCHW tensor format
3. **Run inference** through the YOLOv8n ONNX model
4. **Parse output** for class ID 15 (cat in COCO ordering) above confidence threshold
5. **Print matching paths** to stdout for easy piping to other tools

### Unix Philosophy

```bash
# stdout: just paths (machine-parseable)
# stderr: logging and progress

cat-finder ~/Photos | xargs -I {} cp {} ~/CatPhotos/
```

This separation enables composable Unix pipelines. The tool does one thing well and plays nicely with others.

## Technology Stack

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Rust** | Memory-safe, high-performance core |
| **YOLOv8n** | Lightweight object detection (12MB model) |
| **ONNX Runtime** | Cross-platform inference engine |
| **clap** | CLI argument parsing |
| **ndarray** | Tensor operations |
| **walkdir** | Recursive directory traversal |

Total footprint: ~80MB (runtime + model + binary)

I didn't choose this stack---Claude Code did, based on the requirements. It made good choices.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
cat-finder ~/Photos

# Adjust confidence threshold
cat-finder --confidence 0.5 ~/Photos

# Verbose output with timestamps
cat-finder -v -t ~/Photos

# Copy all cat photos to a new folder
cat-finder ~/Photos | xargs -I {} cp {} ~/CatAlbum/
```

## Honest About Limitations

The README documents failure cases transparently:

| Image Type | Detection Success |
|------------|-------------------|
| Clear photographs | High |
| Artistic/stylized images | Low |
| Cats in clothing | Low |
| Small/partial cats | Variable |
| Low quality/blurry | Variable |

Test results: 7 of 9 cat images detected (77.8% recall). Oil paintings and anthropomorphized cats confuse models trained on photographs. This is documented, not hidden.

## Bonus Features

The project grew organically based on related needs:

**Duplicate Finder**: A second binary for finding duplicate images using size-based filtering followed by SHA-256 checksums.

```bash
find-duplicates ~/Photos
```

**Web Demo**: A Flask-based interface for visual feedback with real-time progress via Server-Sent Events.

These emerged from "while you're at it..." requests during development. Vibe coding makes feature additions nearly frictionless.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sw-ml-study/cat-finder
cd cat-finder
./scripts/setup.sh  # Downloads model, builds project
./cat-finder ~/Photos
```

## The Personal Software Philosophy

**Privacy-first**: All processing happens locally. No cloud APIs, no external services, no data leaving your machine.

**Ownership**: The code is yours. Modify it, extend it, share it, delete it.

**Fit-for-purpose**: Built for exactly what you need, nothing more, nothing less.

**Transparency**: Known limitations documented. No marketing spin.
