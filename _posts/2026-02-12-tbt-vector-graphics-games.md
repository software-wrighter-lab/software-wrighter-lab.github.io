Before pixels, there were vectors. This Throwback Thursday explores the evolution of vector graphics gaming---from military radar displays to arcade classics---and my attempt to recreate them in Rust and WebAssembly.

## My First Vector Display: The IBM 2250

My first encounter with vector graphics was an **IBM 2250 Graphics Display Unit**---introduced in 1964, costing around **$280,000** in period dollars. It connected to an IBM 1130 that acted as a graphics controller for an IBM S/370 mainframe where the graphical applications ran. At that price, nobody was playing games on it---**Computer Aided Design** was the killer app.

The 2250's specifications were impressive for its era:

| Specification | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Display | 21-inch P39 phosphor CRT |
| Resolution | 1024 × 1024 addressable points |
| Usable area | 12" × 12" (square aspect) |
| Refresh rate | ~40 frames/second |
| Input | Light pen for direct interaction |
| Vector drawing | Hardware character generator optional |

The CRT drew lines by steering an electron beam directly---no pixel grid, no rasterization. Just pure geometry traced in phosphor glow. The green P39 phosphor had long persistence, reducing flicker but creating ghostly trails on moving objects.

The light pen was revolutionary: you could point directly at displayed geometry and the system knew *which* vector you were touching. Interactive graphics in 1964.

## The Arcade Era

Vector displays found their way into arcades, where they defined a visual style that's still recognizable today:

| Game | Year | Innovation |
|------|------|------------|
| **Lunar Lander** | 1979 | Physics simulation, thrust/gravity |
| **Asteroids** | 1979 | Wrap-around space, particle effects |
| **BattleZone** | 1980 | Green wireframe 3D, first-person tanks |
| **Tempest** | 1981 | Multi-colored vectors, pseudo-3D depth |

*(Note: Pong (1972) was actually a raster game using discrete logic, but its simple geometry makes it a natural fit for vector recreation.)*

Each generation built on the last. White vectors on black screens gave way to green wireframes, then full color. The hardware pushed boundaries that feel primitive now but were revolutionary then.

## The Vectorcade Project

Vectorcade recreates these mechanics using modern tools:

- **Rust** for game logic and rendering
- **WebAssembly** for browser deployment
- **wgpu** for GPU-accelerated vector rendering
- **Yew** for the web frontend

### Multi-Repo Architecture

The project architecture emerged from a design session with ChatGPT, exploring how to structure a multi-agent development workflow. The result: a DAG of repositories, each with clear ownership boundaries:

```
vectorcade-shared/      (Pure Rust API contracts)
    ↓
vectorcade-fonts/       (Vector font styles)
    ↓
vectorcade-games/       (Game logic: Pong, Asteroids, etc.)
    ↓
vectorcade-render-wgpu/ (wgpu + lyon tessellation)
    ↓
vectorcade-web-yew/     (Yew web shell)
```

This DAG structure allows parallel development with assigned agent roles:

| Agent | Repo | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **A** | vectorcade-shared | Core API steward: minimal, stable, pure |
| **B** | vectorcade-fonts | Font stylist: 3-5 distinct vector styles |
| **C** | vectorcade-games | Game logic: Pong → Asteroids → Lunar Lander |
| **D** | vectorcade-render-wgpu | Renderer: lyon tessellation → wgpu triangles |
| **E** | vectorcade-web-yew | Integrator: UI, mobile controls, PWA |

Each agent works against stable interfaces---the `DrawCmd` display list and `Game` trait---so they don't step on each other.

### The Display List Model

Games don't render directly. They emit **draw commands** that the renderer interprets:

```rust
pub enum DrawCmd {
    Clear { color: Rgba },
    Line(Line2),
    Polyline { pts: Vec<[f32;2]>, closed: bool, stroke: Stroke },
    Text { pos: [f32;2], s: String, size_px: f32, color: Rgba },
    PushTransform(Transform2),
    PopTransform,
}
```

This keeps game logic portable. The same Asteroids code can render through wgpu on desktop, WebGPU in browsers, or even a software rasterizer.

### Vector Fonts

Classic arcade games had distinctive lettering. Vectorcade includes multiple font styles to match:

| Style | Look | Games |
|-------|------|-------|
| `ATARI` | Boxy, utilitarian | Asteroids, Lunar Lander |
| `CINEMATRONICS` | Thin, angular | Star Castle |
| `MIDWAY` | Slightly rounded | Defender |
| `VECTOR_SCANLINE` | Broken segments | "Beam jitter" effect |

Each font is pure vector geometry---no bitmaps, no texture atlases.

### 3D Projection

BattleZone and Tempest need 3D-to-2D projection. Instead of a full 3D renderer, Vectorcade uses a "2.5D pipeline":

```rust
pub struct Camera3 {
    pub pos: [f32;3],
    pub yaw: f32,
    pub pitch: f32,
    pub fov_y_rad: f32,
}

pub fn project_polyline(cam: &Camera3, pts3: &[[f32;3]]) -> Vec<[f32;2]>;
```

Games maintain 3D geometry; the core projects it to 2D lines. Depth-based brightness gives the classic "farther = dimmer" effect.

## Why Rust + WASM?

The combination solves several problems:

1. **Performance**: Games need consistent frame rates; Rust delivers
2. **Portability**: Same code runs native and in browsers
3. **Safety**: No dangling pointers in the game loop
4. **Modern tooling**: Cargo, wasm-pack, Trunk make deployment straightforward

The wgpu + lyon stack provides cross-platform GPU rendering with proper thick-line support (WebGL's `lineWidth` is notoriously inconsistent).

## Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| vectorcade-shared | Functional |
| vectorcade-fonts | Functional |
| vectorcade-games | Playable (5 demos) |
| vectorcade-render-wgpu | Functional |
| vectorcade-web-yew | Functional |

The core architecture works. All five demos are playable in the browser. Polish and audio remain.

## The Demos

The video showcases five demonstrations, progressing from static display to full gameplay:

### 1. IBM 2250 Chessboard

A static image rendered in the style of the original IBM 2250. The 2250 was mainly used for Computer Aided Design, but programmers did create games on it---this chessboard pays tribute to that era.

### 2. Pong (Playable)

A vector implementation of the classic. The original Pong (1972) wasn't actually a vector game---it used discrete logic and a raster display---but some clones used vector hardware. This recreation captures the pure-geometry aesthetic.

### 3. Asteroids (Playable)

One of the most popular vector arcade games. Rotate, thrust, and shoot to survive. The ship and asteroids wrap around screen edges, creating the classic "infinite space" feel.

### 4. BattleZone (Playable)

Green wireframe 3D tanks. Drive through a battlefield, shooting enemies and dodging missiles. One of the first games with true 3D perspective---rendered entirely with vectors.

### 5. Tempest (Playable)

The pinnacle of vector arcade hardware. Move around the edge of geometric tubes, shooting enemies that climb up from the depths. Each level changes the tube shape and color scheme.

### Implementation

Each game implements the same `Game` trait:

```rust
pub trait Game {
    fn metadata(&self) -> GameMeta;
    fn reset(&mut self, ctx: &mut GameCtx);
    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut GameCtx, dt: f32);
    fn render(&mut self, ctx: &mut GameCtx, out: &mut Vec<DrawCmd>);
}
```

This makes games drop-in replaceable in the web shell---no renderer changes needed.

## TODO

The demos are playable but not finished. Remaining work:

- **Music and sound effects**: Authentic arcade audio
- **More aggressive opponents**: AI improvements for challenge
- **Additional levels/difficulties**: Progression and replay value
- **More animations**: Explosions, transitions, effects
