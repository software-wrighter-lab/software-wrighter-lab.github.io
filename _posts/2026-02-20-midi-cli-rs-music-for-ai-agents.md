AI coding agents can write code, generate images, and produce text. But what about music? When I needed background audio for explainer videos, I wanted a tool that AI agents could use directly---no music theory required.

## The Problem

Generating music programmatically is hard. Traditional approaches require understanding music theory, MIDI specifications, instrument mappings, and audio synthesis. That's a lot to ask of an AI agent that just needs a 5-second intro.

I wanted something simpler: a CLI tool where an agent could say "give me 5 seconds of suspenseful music" and get a usable WAV file.

## The Solution: Mood Presets

midi-cli-rs solves this with **mood presets**---curated musical generators that produce complete compositions from a single command:

```bash
# Generate a 5-second suspenseful intro
midi-cli-rs preset --mood suspense --duration 5 -o intro.wav

# Upbeat outro with specific key
midi-cli-rs preset -m upbeat -d 7 --key C --seed 42 -o outro.wav
```

Six moods are available:

| Mood | Character |
|------|-----------|
| `suspense` | Low drones, tremolo strings, tension |
| `eerie` | Sparse tones, diminished harmony |
| `upbeat` | Rhythmic chords, energetic |
| `calm` | Warm pads, gentle arpeggios |
| `ambient` | Textural drones, pentatonic bells |
| `jazz` | Walking bass, brushed drums, piano trio |

Each mood generates multi-layer compositions with appropriate instruments, rhythms, and harmonies. The `--seed` parameter ensures reproducibility---same seed, same output. Different seeds produce meaningful variations in melody contour, rhythm patterns, and instrument choices.

## Melodic Variation

The presets don't just randomize notes---they use a **contour-based variation system**. Changing the seed produces melodies that follow different shapes (ascending, descending, arch, wave) while staying musically coherent. This means you can generate multiple versions of a mood and pick the one that fits best.

## How It Works

The tool generates MIDI programmatically, then renders to WAV using FluidSynth:

```
Mood Preset → MIDI Generation → FluidSynth → WAV Output
```

**MIDI generation** uses the `midly` crate to create standard MIDI files. Each preset generates multiple tracks with different instruments, note patterns, and dynamics.

**Audio rendering** calls FluidSynth as a subprocess with a SoundFont (instrument samples). This avoids LGPL licensing complications---subprocess execution doesn't trigger copyleft.

## Note-Level Control

When presets aren't enough, you can specify exact notes:

```bash
# Note format: PITCH:DURATION:VELOCITY[@OFFSET]
midi-cli-rs generate \
    --notes "C4:0.5:80@0,E4:0.5:80@0.5,G4:0.5:80@1,C5:1:90@1.5" \
    -i piano -t 120 -o arpeggio.wav
```

Or use JSON for complex multi-track arrangements:

```bash
echo '{"tempo":90,"instrument":"piano","notes":[
  {"pitch":"C4","duration":0.5,"velocity":80,"offset":0},
  {"pitch":"E4","duration":0.5,"velocity":80,"offset":0.5},
  {"pitch":"G4","duration":1,"velocity":90,"offset":1}
]}' | midi-cli-rs generate --json -o output.wav
```

## Web UI

For interactive composition, there's a browser-based interface:

```bash
midi-cli-rs serve  # Starts on http://127.0.0.1:3105
```

The **Presets tab** lets you adjust mood, key, duration, intensity, and tempo with immediate audio preview. Click the clock button to generate a time-based seed for unique but reproducible results.

The **Melodies tab** provides note-by-note composition with keyboard shortcuts:
- `a-g` for note pitch
- `[` / `]` to adjust duration
- `+` / `-` to change octave
- `Tab` to navigate between notes

## For AI Agents

The CLI is designed for AI agent usage:

1. **Simple commands**: One line generates complete audio
2. **Reproducible**: Seed values ensure consistent output
3. **Self-documenting**: `--help` includes agent-specific instructions
4. **Composable**: Generate tracks separately, combine with ffmpeg

```bash
# AI agent workflow
midi-cli-rs preset -m suspense -d 5 --seed 1 -o intro.wav
midi-cli-rs preset -m upbeat -d 10 --seed 2 -o main.wav
ffmpeg -i intro.wav -i main.wav -filter_complex concat=n=2:v=0:a=1 final.wav
```

## SoundFont Quality Matters

The quality of generated audio depends heavily on the SoundFont used. SoundFonts are collections of audio samples for each instrument---a tiny SoundFont with compressed samples will sound thin and artificial, while a larger one with high-quality recordings produces professional results.

| SoundFont | Size | Quality | License |
|-----------|------|---------|---------|
| TimGM6mb | ~6MB | Basic | GPL v2 |
| GeneralUser GS | ~30MB | Good | Permissive |
| FluidR3_GM | ~140MB | Very Good | MIT |
| MuseScore_General | ~200MB | Excellent | MIT |

For anything beyond quick prototypes, use a quality SoundFont. The difference is dramatic---the same MIDI file can sound like a toy keyboard or a real instrument depending on the samples.

The tool auto-detects SoundFonts in common locations (`~/.soundfonts/`, `/opt/homebrew/share/soundfonts/`, etc.), or specify one explicitly with `--soundfont`.

## Technical Details

Built with Rust 2024 edition using permissively licensed dependencies:

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| midly | MIDI file generation |
| clap | CLI argument parsing |
| serde | JSON serialization |
| rand | Randomization for presets |
| axum | Web server (for `serve` command) |

FluidSynth is called as a subprocess for WAV rendering, keeping the main codebase MIT-licensed.

## Try It

Listen to [sample outputs](https://softwarewrighter.github.io/midi-cli-rs/), or build locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/softwarewrighter/midi-cli-rs.git
cd midi-cli-rs
cargo build --release
./target/release/midi-cli-rs preset -m jazz -d 5 -o jazz.wav
```

Requires FluidSynth for WAV output (`brew install fluid-synth` on macOS).

*Music generation shouldn't require a music degree. With mood presets, AI agents can add audio to their creative toolkit.*
