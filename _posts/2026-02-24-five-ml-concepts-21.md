## Today's Five

### 1. Prompt Injection

**Malicious instructions embedded in user input that override intended system behavior.** An attacker crafts text that tricks an AI into ignoring its original instructions.

This is a major security concern for LLM-integrated applications.

> Like slipping a forged instruction into a trusted document.

### 2. Jailbreaks

**Techniques that attempt to bypass safety constraints in AI systems.** These attacks exploit gaps between a model's capabilities and its safety training.

Safety training can fail due to competing objectives or mismatched generalization.

> Like convincing a guard to bend the rules.

### 3. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

**A recurrent neural network unit with gates that control memory flow.** GRUs decide what information to keep and what to discard at each time step.

Simpler than LSTM but designed for similar sequence modeling tasks.

> Like a notepad where you decide what to keep and what to erase.

### 4. Planning vs Prediction

**Prediction forecasts likely outcomes. Planning evaluates actions across possible futures.** Accurate predictions don't guarantee good decisions---you also need to model how actions affect outcomes.

This is a key gap in many AI/ML systems.

> Like knowing it will rain versus deciding whether to bring an umbrella.

### 5. Production Rollbacks

**Reverting to a previous stable model version after deployment issues.** When a new model causes problems in production, rolling back quickly minimizes impact.

Essential MLOps practice for maintaining system reliability.

> Like reloading a saved game state when something breaks.
