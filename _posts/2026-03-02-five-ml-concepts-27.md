## Today's Five

### 1. Elastic Weight Consolidation

**Adding a penalty that discourages changing parameters important to previous tasks.** Importance is estimated using Fisher information from prior training.

This helps models learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting.

> Like protecting well-worn neural pathways while building new ones.

### 2. Replay Buffers

**Storing examples from earlier tasks and mixing them into new training.** Past data is replayed alongside current examples during optimization.

This reinforces previous knowledge while learning new data.

> Like reviewing old flashcards while studying new material.

### 3. Parameter Routing

**Activating different subsets of model parameters depending on the task or input.** Mixture-of-experts and conditional computation route inputs to specialized weights.

Enables specialization without fully separate models.

> Like having different experts handle different questions.

### 4. Memory-Augmented Networks

**Adding external memory modules that neural networks can read from and write to.** The model learns to store and retrieve information during inference.

Extends beyond purely weight-based memory to explicit storage.

> Like giving a calculator access to a notepad.

### 5. Model Editing

**Targeted weight updates to modify specific behaviors without full retraining.** Locate and adjust the parameters responsible for particular facts or behaviors.

Allows fast corrections and knowledge updates post-training.

> Like editing a specific entry in an encyclopedia instead of rewriting the whole book.
