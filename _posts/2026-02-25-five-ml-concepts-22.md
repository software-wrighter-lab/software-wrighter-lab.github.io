## Today's Five

### 1. RSFT (Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning)

**A method where many model outputs are generated, weaker ones are filtered out, and the best samples are used for further fine-tuning.** It improves output quality without full reinforcement learning.

The model learns from its own best attempts.

> Like practicing many attempts and studying only your best ones.

### 2. Model Steerability

**The ability to adjust a model's behavior through prompts, parameters, or control mechanisms.** This allows flexible behavior without retraining.

Steerable models can adapt to different tasks or styles at inference time.

> Like steering a car instead of letting it move in a fixed direction.

### 3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

**A recurrent neural network architecture with gates that regulate memory flow.** It was designed to mitigate vanishing gradient problems in sequence modeling.

LSTMs decide what to remember and what to forget at each time step.

> Like a notebook where you choose what to keep and what to forget.

### 4. Why More Data Beats Better Models

**In many cases, adding high-quality data improves performance more than small architecture improvements.** Data scale often matters as much as model design.

This is sometimes called "the unreasonable effectiveness of data."

> Like practicing with many real conversations instead of perfecting one grammar rule.

### 5. System Reliability vs Model Quality

**A slightly less accurate model that runs reliably can outperform a fragile but slightly better one.** Engineers balance uptime, latency, and stability against pure accuracy.

Production systems need both correctness and dependability.

> Like choosing a reliable car over a faster one that breaks down often.
