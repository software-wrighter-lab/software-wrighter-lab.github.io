## Today's Five

### 1. Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

**Large neural networks contain smaller subnetworks that, when trained from the right initialization, achieve similar performance.** These "winning tickets" exist before training begins.

The key insight: you can find and train just the winning subnetwork.

> Like finding a winning lottery ticket hidden among many losing ones.

### 2. Sparse Activation

**Only a subset of neurons activate for each input, even in models with many parameters.** This allows large capacity without using everything at once.

Mixture-of-experts architectures explicitly design for this pattern.

> Like a library where only relevant books light up for each query.

### 3. Conditional Computation

**The model dynamically activates only certain components depending on the input.** Different inputs route to different experts or pathways.

This improves efficiency and scalability without proportional compute increase.

> Like routing patients to the right specialist instead of seeing every doctor.

### 4. Inference Parallelism

**Model execution can be split across multiple devices to reduce latency or increase throughput.** Tensor parallelism splits layers; pipeline parallelism splits stages.

Essential for serving large models in production.

> Like dividing a puzzle so multiple people work on it simultaneously.

### 5. Compute Optimality Hypothesis

**Empirical scaling laws suggest performance improves when model size, data, and compute are balanced.** Adding only one resource may not yield optimal gains.

Chinchilla showed many models were undertrained relative to their size.

> Like baking a cake where proportions matter more than just adding extra ingredients.
