## The Efficient Frontier

In economics, the "efficient frontier" is the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest return for a given level of risk.

In AI, it's the models offering the **best capability for a given size**.

## The Contenders

| Model | Params | Source | Key Strength |
|-------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Phi-2** | 2.7B | Microsoft | Reasoning, synthetic data |
| **Gemma-2B** | 2B | Google | Distillation, multilingual |
| **SmolLM2-1.7B** | 1.7B | HuggingFace | 11T tokens, fast inference |
| **SmolLM3-3B** | 3B | HuggingFace | Dual reasoning, 6 languages |

## Benchmark Results

Actual measurements on Apple Silicon (M-series) from [efficient-llm](https://github.com/softwarewrighter/efficient-llm):

| Model | MMLU | GSM8K | HumanEval | Speed (CPU) | Memory |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Phi-2** | 61.7% | 57.0% | 50.0% | 7.1 tok/s | 5.2GB |
| **Gemma-2B** | 38.9% | 18.0% | 90.0% | 8.5 tok/s | 4.7GB |
| **SmolLM2** | 55.6% | * | * | 3.7 tok/s | 3.2GB |

*SmolLM2 GSM8K/HumanEval scores reflect prompt format incompatibility, not capability.

## The Key Insight: Data Quality Beats Parameters

**Phi-2 achieves 61.7% MMLU with only 2.7B parameters.**

For comparison:
- Llama-2-7B: ~46% MMLU
- Llama-2-13B: ~55% MMLU

Phi-2 beats models 5x its size. The secret? **Synthetic textbook training.**

Microsoft generated high-quality educational content specifically designed to teach reasoning. Quality data > quantity data > model size.

## Model Profiles

### Phi-2: The Reasoning Champion

```
Strengths: Math, logic, code understanding
Weakness:  Less conversational
Best for:  Technical tasks, chain-of-thought
```

Phi-2 was trained on "textbook quality" synthetic data. It thinks like a textbook explains.

### Gemma-2B: The Distillation Expert

```
Strengths: Multilingual, edge deployment
Weakness:  Lower benchmark scores
Best for:  Production apps, Google ecosystem
```

Google distilled knowledge from larger models into this compact package. Great tooling and documentation.

### SmolLM2-1.7B: The Speed Demon

```
Strengths: Fastest inference, smallest footprint
Weakness:  Prompt format sensitivity
Best for:  Memory-constrained environments
```

HuggingFace trained on 11T tokens---massive overtraining like TinyLlama but at a slightly larger scale.

### SmolLM3-3B: The Balanced Choice

```
Strengths: Dual reasoning modes, 6 languages
Weakness:  Newest, less battle-tested
Best for:  General-purpose small model needs
```

The latest from HuggingFace, designed to be the go-to small model.

## Decision Framework

```
├── Need best reasoning?           → Phi-2
├── Need instruction following?    → SmolLM2 or SmolLM3
├── Need multilingual?             → Gemma-2B or SmolLM3
├── Memory constrained (<4GB)?     → SmolLM2 + INT4
├── Need Google ecosystem?         → Gemma-2B
├── General purpose?               → SmolLM3
└── Maximum quality per byte?      → Phi-2
```

## Running the Benchmarks

```bash
git clone https://github.com/softwarewrighter/efficient-llm
cd efficient-llm

# Setup
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install torch transformers accelerate bitsandbytes datasets tqdm

# HuggingFace login (required for Gemma)
huggingface-cli login

# Download and benchmark
python download_models.py
python benchmark_quality.py
python benchmark_speed.py
python benchmark_memory.py

# Interactive demos
python demo_reasoning.py
python demo_code.py
python demo_chat.py
```

## Hardware Requirements

| Setup | Models You Can Run |
|-------|-------------------|
| 4GB RAM | SmolLM2 (INT4) |
| 8GB RAM | All models (INT4) |
| 16GB RAM | All models (FP16) |
| Apple Silicon | All models (MPS) |

## Implementation Details

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Primary Language** | Python |
| **Source Files** | 7 `.py` files |
| **Estimated Size** | ~1.4 KLOC |
| **Framework** | Transformers, PyTorch |
| **Build System** | uv / pip |
| **Key Features** | MMLU/GSM8K/HumanEval benchmarks, demos |

**Good for you if:** You want to benchmark 2-3B models, compare quality vs speed tradeoffs, or run interactive comparisons between Phi-2, Gemma, and SmolLM.

**Complexity:** Low. Similar structure to billion-llm. Standalone Python scripts for each benchmark and demo. Requires HuggingFace authentication for Gemma access.

## Series Recap

Over six parts, we've explored the cutting edge of small model research:

| Part | Model/Topic | Key Insight |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | TRM (<1K params) | Iteration beats scale |
| 2 | MobileLLM (350M) | Offline AI is practical |
| 3 | HRM (27M) | Hierarchy enables reasoning |
| 4 | BDH | Sparsity enables interpretability |
| 5 | 1B models | The efficiency sweet spot |
| 6 | 2-3B models | Data quality beats parameters |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Data quality beats parameter count.** Phi-2 proves careful curation outperforms brute scaling.

2. **The 2-3B range is remarkably capable.** These models handle real tasks, not just demos.

3. **Each model has its niche.** Match the model to your use case.

4. **Quantization makes everything accessible.** INT4 lets you run 3B models on 4GB RAM.

5. **The frontier keeps moving.** SmolLM3 is weeks old. Better models are coming.

## What We've Learned

Small models aren't a compromise---they're a different optimization target. When you can't throw compute at a problem, you're forced to be clever:

- Recursive reasoning (TRM)
- Mobile-optimized architectures (MobileLLM)
- Hierarchical decomposition (HRM)
- Sparse interpretable activations (BDH)
- Overtraining on quality data (TinyLlama, Phi-2)

These techniques will eventually feed back into large models too. Small model research isn't a dead end---it's the frontier.
