## Today's Five

### 1. Neural Collapse

**In overparameterized networks trained to zero loss, class representations converge late in training to a symmetric, maximally separated structure.** The last-layer features and classifiers align into a simplex equiangular tight frame.

This geometric phenomenon appears universally across architectures.

> Like students settling into evenly spaced seats by the end of class.

### 2. Grokking

**In some tasks, especially small algorithmic ones, models memorize quickly but only later suddenly generalize.** The jump from memorization to understanding can happen long after training loss reaches zero.

Weight decay and longer training appear necessary for this phase transition.

> Like cramming facts for an exam, then later realizing you truly understand.

### 3. SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization)

**Instead of minimizing loss at a single point, SAM minimizes loss under small weight perturbations, finding flatter regions.** Flatter minima tend to generalize better than sharp ones.

The optimizer seeks robustness to parameter noise.

> Like choosing a wide hilltop instead of balancing on a sharp peak.

### 4. Mechanistic Interpretability

**Researchers analyze activations and internal circuits to understand how specific computations are implemented inside models.** The goal is reverse-engineering neural networks into understandable components.

This reveals attention heads, induction heads, and other interpretable patterns.

> Like mapping the wiring of an unknown machine to see how it works.

### 5. Self-Training Instability

**When models train on their own generated data, feedback loops can amplify small errors over time.** Each iteration compounds mistakes, causing distributional drift.

Careful filtering and external grounding help mitigate this.

> Like copying a copy repeatedly until the meaning drifts.
