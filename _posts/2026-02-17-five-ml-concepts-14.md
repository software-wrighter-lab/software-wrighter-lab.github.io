## Today's Five

### 1. ROC / AUC

**ROC curves plot true positive rate against false positive rate across all classification thresholds.** AUC (Area Under the Curve) summarizes overall ranking performance in a single number.

AUC of 0.5 means random guessing; 1.0 means perfect ranking.

> Like judging a student by considering every possible passing grade cutoff.

### 2. Spurious Correlations

**Coincidental patterns in training data that don't reflect true relationships.** Models that rely on them can fail when the coincidence disappears.

Dataset curation and diverse evaluation help detect spurious features.

> Like assuming umbrellas cause rain because you always see them together.

### 3. Gradient Clipping

**Limiting the size of gradients during backpropagation.** This helps prevent exploding gradients and unstable training, especially in recurrent networks.

Clipping can be by value or by global norm.

> Like putting a speed limit on a car so it doesn't lose control.

### 4. Loss Landscapes

**How model error changes across different parameter settings.** Training is like navigating this surface toward regions of lower loss.

Flat minima may generalize better than sharp ones.

> Like hiking through mountains searching for the lowest valley, feeling the slope beneath your feet.

### 5. Cold Start Problems

**Difficulty predicting for new users or items with no history.** Without prior data, personalization becomes difficult.

Solutions include content-based features, popularity fallbacks, or asking initial questions.

> Like a librarian trying to recommend books to someone who just walked in.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **ROC / AUC** | Classifier performance across thresholds |
| **Spurious Correlations** | Coincidental patterns that don't generalize |
| **Gradient Clipping** | Limit gradient size for stability |
| **Loss Landscapes** | Error surface over parameter space |
| **Cold Start** | No history for new users/items |
