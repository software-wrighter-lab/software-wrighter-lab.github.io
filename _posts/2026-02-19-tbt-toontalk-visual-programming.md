I first discovered ToonTalk during the Windows XP era---probably around 2003 or 2004. It was unlike anything I'd seen: a programming environment disguised as a video game where you trained robots by showing them what to do. The concept stuck with me for two decades.

## What is ToonTalk?

ToonTalk is a visual programming environment created by [Ken Kahn](https://toontalk.com/English/kenkahn.htm) in 1995. The "Toon" stands for cartoon---every abstract programming concept is mapped to a concrete, animated metaphor:

| Concept | ToonTalk Metaphor |
|---------|-------------------|
| Variables | Boxes with numbered holes |
| Values | Numbers, text, images in boxes |
| Comparison | Scales that tip when values differ |
| Functions | Robots that watch and learn |
| Message passing | Birds that carry items to nests |
| Garbage collection | Trucks that haul away unused items |

The design was influenced by games like *The Legend of Zelda* and *Robot Odyssey*---the kind of games that made you think while you played.

## Programming by Demonstration

The core idea is radical: you don't write code, you *show* a robot what to do.

1. Create a robot and put it in "training mode"
2. Perform actions while the robot watches (move items, compare values, etc.)
3. The robot records your actions as a program
4. Give the robot a box matching the training pattern---it executes the learned behavior

This is programming by demonstration. The robot generalizes from your example, matching patterns and applying transformations. It's the same conceptual model as teaching a child: "Watch what I do, then you try."

## Three Generations

ToonTalk has existed in three forms:

| Version | Era | Technology |
|---------|-----|------------|
| **Original ToonTalk** | 1995-2009 | C++, 3D desktop application |
| **ToonTalk Reborn** | 2014-2017 | JavaScript/jQuery web app |
| **tt-rs** | 2025-2026 | Rust/WebAssembly/Yew |

The original was a full 3D world---cities, houses, helicopters, even bombs for debugging. Ken Kahn later created [ToonTalk Reborn](https://github.com/ToonTalk/ToonTalk), a simplified JavaScript version that runs in browsers.

## Why I Built tt-rs

When I rediscovered ToonTalk Reborn a few years ago, I wanted to experiment with the concepts myself. But diving into a large jQuery codebase wasn't appealing. So I did what any reasonable person would do: I vibe coded my own version in Rust.

**tt-rs** is a modern reimplementation using:

- **Rust** for core logic
- **WebAssembly** for browser execution
- **Yew** for reactive UI
- **SVG/CSS** for graphics and animations

It's not a port---it's a fresh implementation inspired by the same ideas. Building it myself lets me understand the concepts deeply and experiment with variations.

## Three Learning Levels

The demo introduces concepts progressively through three levels:

| Level | Concepts | Widgets |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **tt1** | Basics | Numbers, boxes, scales, wand, vacuum |
| **tt2** | Messaging | Birds and nests for communication |
| **tt3** | Automation | Sensors (time, random) + robots |

Level one covers the fundamentals: numbers with arithmetic, boxes as containers, scales for comparison, and tools for copying and removing. Level two adds asynchronous messaging---birds carry items to their paired nests. Level three brings sensors that produce values and robots that automate actions.

## Current Features

The [live demo](https://sw-fun.github.io/tt-rs/) includes:

**Widgets:**
- **Numbers**: Rational arithmetic with +, -, *, / operators
- **Boxes**: Configurable containers with 0-9 holes (resize with keyboard)
- **Text**: Basic text display
- **Scales**: Visual comparison that tips when values differ
- **Robot**: Training mode, action recording, execution
- **Bird/Nest**: Message passing with pairing and delivery
- **Sensors**: Time (milliseconds) and random number generation

**Tools:**
- **Wand**: Copy any widget
- **Vacuum**: Remove widgets
- **Magnifier**: Inspect nest message queues and robot actions

**Interactions:**
- Drag-and-drop with visual feedback
- Box joining (drop box on edge of another)
- Box splitting (drop box on a number)
- Contextual help panel with level-specific content
- Puzzle system with animated "Show Me" demos

## Robot Training

The core feature is programming by demonstration:

1. **Click robot** to enter training mode (yellow glow indicates "I'm watching")
2. **Perform actions** while the robot records (arithmetic, copy, remove, move to box)
3. **Click robot** again to stop training
4. **Click robot** to replay---it executes the recorded sequence

The tutorials demonstrate this workflow step by step. In the "Train Robot" tutorial, you teach a robot to move a number into a box. In "Robot Sensors," you train a robot to generate random numbers, apply modulo, and send results to a nest via a bird.

## Interactive Tutorials

Each tutorial has two parts:

1. **Show Me**: Watch an animated demonstration where a cursor walks through the solution
2. **Practice**: Try it yourself with the same widgets

The tutorials cover:
- Fill a box with numbers
- Add numbers together
- Copy widgets with the wand
- Send messages with birds and nests
- Train your first robot
- Combine robots with sensors

## What's Next

The immediate priorities:

1. **Pattern matching** - Robot generalizes from specific values to "any number"
2. **Watched execution** - See robot work step-by-step with animated cursor
3. **Persistence** - Save and load workspaces

Long term, I'd like to add the 3D elements from the original---the cities, the houses, the helicopter view. But that's a much larger project.

## The Enduring Appeal

What makes ToonTalk fascinating isn't just the visual metaphors---it's the *computational model*. Under the hood, ToonTalk implements concurrent constraint logic programming. The robots are essentially guarded Horn clauses. The birds and nests implement the actor model.

Heavy concepts, but you don't need to know any of that to use it. You just train robots by example. The abstraction is complete.

That's why it stuck with me for twenty years. Good abstractions are rare. When you find one, it's worth understanding deeply.
