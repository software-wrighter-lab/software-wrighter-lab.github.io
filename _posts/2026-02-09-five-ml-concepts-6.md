## Today's Five

### 1. Regularization

**Techniques that reduce overfitting by adding constraints or penalties during training.** Common examples include L2 weight decay, L1 sparsity, dropout, and early stopping.

The goal is better generalization, not just fitting the training set.

> Like adding friction so a model can't take the easiest overfit path.

### 2. BERT

**Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.** A transformer encoder trained with masked language modeling: predicting hidden tokens using context from both sides.

It was a major step forward for many NLP tasks after its 2018 release.

> Like filling in blanks by reading the whole sentence, not just the words before it.

### 3. RoPE (Rotary Positional Embeddings)

**A way to represent token position inside attention by rotating query and key vectors as a function of position.** This gives attention information about relative order and distance.

It's widely used in modern transformer models.

> Like turning a dial differently for each position so the model can tell where tokens are.

### 4. Prompting

**Crafting inputs to steer a model toward the output you want.** Small changes in instructions, examples, or format can change behavior significantly.

A key skill for working effectively with language models.

> Like asking a question in just the right way to get a useful answer.

### 5. Positional Encoding

**Transformers need a way to represent token order, because attention alone doesn't include sequence position.** Different methods do this, including learned embeddings and rotary approaches like RoPE.

Without it, "the cat sat on the mat" would be indistinguishable from "mat the on sat cat the."

> Like numbering the pages of a shuffled book so you can read them in order.
