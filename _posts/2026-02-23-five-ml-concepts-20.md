## Today's Five

### 1. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

**VAEs are probabilistic autoencoders that learn a structured latent distribution.** By sampling from that distribution, they can generate new examples similar to the training data.

The key innovation is regularizing the latent space to be smooth and continuous.

> Like learning not just to summarize books, but to create new ones in a similar style.

### 2. Uncertainty Estimation

**Models can estimate how confident they should be in predictions.** Some uncertainty comes from noisy data (aleatoric), and some from limited knowledge (epistemic).

Knowing when a model is uncertain enables safer decision-making.

> Like a weather forecast giving seventy percent chance of rain instead of a simple yes or no.

### 3. Why Interpretability Is Hard

**Neural networks represent information across many interacting parameters.** No single component cleanly maps to a human concept.

Distributed representations enable powerful learning but resist simple explanations.

> Like trying to explain a dream by pointing to individual neurons.

### 4. Gradient Noise

**When training with mini-batches, gradients vary from step to step.** A little noise can help exploration, but too much can slow convergence.

Batch size, learning rate, and gradient clipping all influence this noise level.

> Like getting slightly different directions each time you ask for help.

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop Systems

**Humans review, supervise, or override model decisions in critical workflows.** This improves safety and accountability in high-stakes applications.

The approach combines model efficiency with human judgment where it matters most.

> Like a pilot monitoring autopilot and stepping in when necessary.
