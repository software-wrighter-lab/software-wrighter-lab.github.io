## Today's Five

### 1. Cross-Validation

**A technique that splits data into multiple folds to evaluate model performance on data it wasn't trained on.** By rotating which data is held out, it gives a more reliable estimate of generalization.

Essential for honest model evaluation.

> Like practicing with different sets of flashcards to see if you actually learned the material.

### 2. GPT

**Generative Pre-trained Transformer.** A family of autoregressive language models trained to predict the next token in a sequence.

Many AI assistants and chatbots are built on this approach.

> Like autocomplete, but scaled up and trained on vast text data.

### 3. GQA (Grouped Query Attention)

**An attention variant where multiple query heads share key and value projections.** This reduces memory usage and can speed up inference compared to standard multi-head attention.

Widely adopted in efficient transformer architectures.

> Like several students sharing one set of notes instead of copying everything separately.

### 4. Context Window

**The maximum number of tokens a model can process in a single forward pass.** Larger context windows allow longer inputs, but increase memory and compute costs.

A key constraint in language model design.

> Like the size of a desk that limits how many papers you can spread out at once.

### 5. Self-Attention

**A mechanism where each token computes attention scores with other tokens in the same sequence.** This lets the model weigh which parts of the input are most relevant to each position.

The core operation inside transformers.

> Like everyone in a meeting deciding who to listen to based on the conversation.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Cross-Validation** | Rotate held-out data for reliable evaluation |
| **GPT** | Predict next token, at scale |
| **GQA** | Shared keys/values for efficient attention |
| **Context Window** | How much the model sees at once |
| **Self-Attention** | Each token attends to all others |
