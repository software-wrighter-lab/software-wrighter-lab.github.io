## Today's Five

### 1. Warmup

**Gradually increasing the learning rate at the start of training as part of a learning rate schedule.** This helps stabilize early training when gradients can be noisy.

Warmup is especially important for large batch training.

> Like stretching before a sprint instead of starting at full speed.

### 2. Data Leakage

**When information unavailable at deployment accidentally influences model training.** This creates artificially high validation scores that don't reflect real-world performance.

Common sources include future data, preprocessing on full dataset, or duplicate samples.

> Like memorizing test answers instead of learning the material.

### 3. Mode Collapse

**When a generative model produces limited output diversity.** The generator learns to produce only a few outputs that fool the discriminator.

A major challenge in GAN training that various architectures attempt to address.

> Like a musician who only plays one song no matter the request.

### 4. Blue/Green Deployment

**Maintaining two production environments and switching traffic between them.** One serves live traffic while the other is updated and tested.

Enables instant rollback if problems occur.

> Like having a backup stage ready so the show never stops.

### 5. Reward Hacking

**When agents exploit reward functions in unintended ways.** The agent optimizes the reward signal rather than the intended objective.

A key challenge in reinforcement learning and AI alignment.

> Like gaming the grading rubric instead of learning the material.
