## Today's Five

### 1. Train / Validation / Test Split

**Data is divided into training, validation, and test sets.** Training learns patterns, validation tunes hyperparameters, test evaluates final performance.

Never use test data for any decisions during development---it should only be touched once.

> Like practicing on homework, checking with practice tests, then taking the real exam.

### 2. Overconfidence

**Models can assign very high probabilities to incorrect predictions.** This is often related to poor calibration and can be dangerous in high-stakes applications.

Temperature scaling and other calibration methods can help align confidence with accuracy.

> Like a student who is absolutely certain of a wrong answer.

### 3. Batch Normalization

**Normalizes layer activations during training to improve stability and convergence.** Each mini-batch's activations are normalized to have zero mean and unit variance.

This reduces internal covariate shift and often allows higher learning rates.

> Like keeping everyone on a similar pace during training so no one runs too far ahead.

### 4. Optimization vs Generalization

**Training loss can decrease while test performance does not improve.** Good optimization does not guarantee good generalization.

A model can perfectly fit training data while failing on new examples---this is overfitting.

> Like memorizing last year's exam instead of understanding the subject.

### 5. A/B Testing Models

**Comparing two model versions using controlled live traffic experiments.** Users are randomly assigned to see predictions from model A or model B.

Statistical analysis determines which model performs better on real-world metrics.

> Like taste-testing two recipes with real customers to see which works better.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Train/Val/Test** | Separate data for learning, tuning, and evaluation |
| **Overconfidence** | High probability on wrong predictions |
| **Batch Normalization** | Normalize activations for stable training |
| **Optimization vs Generalization** | Low train loss ≠ good test performance |
| **A/B Testing** | Compare models with live experiments |
