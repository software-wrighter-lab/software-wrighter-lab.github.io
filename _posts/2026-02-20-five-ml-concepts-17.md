## Today's Five

### 1. Benchmark Leakage

**When benchmark or test data influences training, tuning, or model selection, evaluation results become unreliable.** This inflates reported performance beyond real-world capability.

Strict separation between development and evaluation data is essential for honest assessment.

> Like practicing with the exact questions that will appear on the final exam.

### 2. Concept Drift vs Data Drift

**Data drift occurs when input distributions change. Concept drift occurs when the relationship between inputs and outputs changes.** Both can degrade model performance over time.

Data drift: customers buy different products. Concept drift: what "good" means has changed.

> Like customers buying different products versus products changing what they mean.

### 3. Weight Decay

**A regularization method that penalizes large weights, often implemented as L2 regularization.** This encourages simpler models that generalize better.

Weight decay adds a term proportional to the squared magnitude of weights to the loss function.

> Like encouraging shorter, simpler answers instead of overly complicated ones.

### 4. Scaling Laws

**Empirical relationships showing how performance tends to improve as model size, data, or compute increase.** These relationships follow predictable power-law curves.

Scaling laws help predict resource requirements for target performance levels.

> Like noticing that adding horsepower often increases a car's speed, but with diminishing returns.

### 5. Shadow Deployment

**Running a new model in parallel with production without affecting live user decisions.** The shadow model processes real traffic but its outputs are only logged, not served.

This allows safe evaluation before full deployment.

> Like a new chef preparing the same dishes in the back kitchen before serving customers.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Benchmark Leakage** | Test data contaminating training/selection |
| **Concept vs Data Drift** | Changed relationships vs changed inputs |
| **Weight Decay** | L2 penalty discourages large weights |
| **Scaling Laws** | Performance scales predictably with resources |
| **Shadow Deployment** | Test safely alongside production |
