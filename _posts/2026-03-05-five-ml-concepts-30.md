## The Journey So Far

For the past thirty episodes, we've explored **145 machine learning concepts** in under 30 seconds each.

**From backpropagation to scaling laws.**
From dropout to distribution shift.
From RAG to reward hacking.

We covered:
- **Foundations** — the building blocks of neural networks and learning algorithms
- **Failure modes** — how models break, overfit, forget, and hallucinate
- **Deployment realities** — what happens when models meet production
- **Alignment challenges** — ensuring models do what we actually want

## What's Changing

Machine learning is evolving rapidly. The foundational primitives are now well-established—the concepts we covered form a stable vocabulary.

But new research is reshaping how we *apply* these primitives:
- Memory and retrieval architectures
- Reasoning and planning systems
- Sparsity and efficiency at scale
- Robustness and generalization
- Alignment and safety

30 seconds per concept was a good start. But some ideas deserve more depth.

## What's Next: Frontier ML Thinking

Starting soon: **Frontier ML Thinking**.

One concept. Two minutes. Deeper implications.

We'll explore the cutting edge—ideas from papers published in the last 12 months that build on the foundations we've covered.

## If You're New Here

Start with [Five ML Concepts Episodes 1–29](/series/#five-ml-concepts). Each episode covers five concepts in five minutes total. The full series provides a foundation in modern machine learning vocabulary.

## If You've Been Here the Whole Time

You're ready for the frontier.

## Why the Papers Look "Old"

When I tabulated the papers behind the **145 concepts** in this series, something looked odd: almost none of the cited papers were from the last two years.

This is not a mistake—it's a feature of how ML knowledge evolves.

### Seminal papers don't keep getting re-written

Most concepts in this series are *primitives*: backpropagation, transformers, RAG, dropout, calibration, and so on. Each primitive has an **origin paper** that introduced it. Once the primitive exists, later research focuses on:
- Scaling it
- Combining it with other ideas
- Benchmarking it
- Making it more efficient
- Making it safer

That kind of work produces *new papers*, but not new "origin papers."

### What this reveals about the field

The core intellectual breakthroughs of modern ML largely occurred between **2016 and 2022**. The frontier has since shifted from inventing new primitives to:
- **Memory and retrieval systems**
- **Continual learning**
- **Agent architectures**
- **Tool use and planning**
- **Sparsity and efficiency at scale**
- **Alignment and safety**

That's exactly what **Frontier ML Thinking** will explore: ideas from papers published in the last 12 months that build on these foundations.

#### 2025 and Beyond
{: .year-heading}

Since 2024, no widely-adopted new fundamental ML concepts have emerged. Research has shifted from inventing primitives to composing, scaling, and applying them. Papers from 2025–2026 will be covered in our new series: **[Frontier ML Thinking](/series/#frontier-ml-thinking)**—one concept, two minutes, deeper implications.
