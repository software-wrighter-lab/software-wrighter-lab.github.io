## Today's Five

### 1. Preference Learning

**Instead of learning from fixed labels, models are trained from comparisons between outputs.** This helps align model behavior with human judgments.

The approach works well when absolute quality is hard to define but relative preferences are easier to express.

> Like learning to cook by asking which dish tastes better.

### 2. Ensembling

**Ensembling combines predictions from multiple models.** Different models make different errors, and combining them can improve robustness.

Common strategies include voting, averaging, and stacking models together.

> Like asking several experts and averaging their opinions.

### 3. Why ML Is Fragile

**Models rely on statistical patterns learned from data.** When those patterns shift, performance can degrade quickly.

This fragility emerges because models optimize for training distributions, not arbitrary future scenarios.

> Like a spell checker that works on common words but struggles with unusual ones.

### 4. Epoch

**An epoch is one complete pass through the training dataset.** Multiple epochs allow the model to refine its weights over repeated passes.

Training typically continues for many epochs until validation performance stops improving.

> Like reading a textbook from beginning to end more than once.

### 5. Cost vs Quality Tradeoffs

**Increasing model size or compute often improves performance, but also increases cost and latency.** Engineers balance quality against budget and responsiveness.

Production systems often use smaller, faster models rather than the largest available.

> Like choosing between a luxury car and an economy car depending on your needs.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Preference Learning** | Train from comparisons, not labels |
| **Ensembling** | Combine models for robustness |
| **ML Fragility** | Statistical models break on distribution shift |
| **Epoch** | One pass through training data |
| **Cost vs Quality** | Bigger isn't always better in production |
