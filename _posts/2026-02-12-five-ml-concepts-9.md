## Today's Five

### 1. Dropout

**A regularization technique that randomly disables units during training.** This encourages the network to rely on multiple pathways instead of memorizing patterns.

It helps reduce overfitting, especially in large models.

> Like training a team where random members sit out each practice, so no one becomes a single point of failure.

### 2. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

**A training approach where humans rank or compare model outputs to produce a reward signal.** The model is then optimized to better match human preferences.

This technique is central to aligning language models with human intent.

> Like teaching by grading essays instead of dictating every word.

### 3. Inference

**The process of running a trained model to make predictions on new data.** Training updates the model's parameters; inference uses them.

The distinction matters for optimization, deployment, and cost.

> Like the difference between studying for an exam and actually taking it.

### 4. Quantization

**Reducing the numerical precision used to store and compute model weights.** This can shrink model size and speed up inference, sometimes with a small accuracy tradeoff.

Essential for deploying large models on limited hardware.

> Like compressing a high-resolution photo into a smaller file that still looks good.

### 5. Flash Attention

**An optimized attention algorithm designed to reduce memory usage.** It avoids materializing the full attention matrix by computing attention in blocks.

This enables longer sequences and faster training.

> Like reading a book chapter by chapter instead of photocopying the whole thing first.
