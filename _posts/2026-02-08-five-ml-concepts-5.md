## Today's Five

### 1. Perceptron

**The simplest neural network: a single linear unit with weights and a bias.** It computes a weighted sum and applies a threshold or activation.

It inspired modern neural networks, even though today's models are far more complex.

> Like a single voter weighing inputs before deciding yes or no.

### 2. Pre-training

**Training a model on a large, general dataset before adapting it to a specific task.** This gives the model broad patterns that later training can refine.

BERT, GPT, and most modern LLMs use this approach.

> Like going to medical school before choosing a specialty.

### 3. Speculative Decoding

**A technique where a small, fast model proposes tokens, and a larger model verifies or rejects them in parallel.** This can speed up inference without changing final outputs.

A key optimization for production LLM deployments.

> Like a junior writer drafting text for a senior editor to approve in batches.

### 4. In-Context Learning (ICL)

**When a model adapts its behavior using examples in the prompt, without updating its weights.** It allows flexible task behavior at inference time.

This emergent capability surprised researchers when GPT-3 demonstrated it.

> Like solving a new puzzle after seeing a few worked examples.

### 5. Latent Space

**The internal representations a model learns as it processes data.** In this space, similar inputs tend to be located near each other.

It's not a literal place, but a useful way to think about how models organize information.

> Like a map where cities are arranged by similarity instead of geography.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Perceptron** | Single linear unit---the neural network ancestor |
| **Pre-training** | Learn general patterns before specializing |
| **Speculative Decoding** | Draft fast, verify in parallel |
| **ICL** | Adapt from prompt examples without training |
| **Latent Space** | Internal representations where similar things cluster |
