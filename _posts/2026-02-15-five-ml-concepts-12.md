## Today's Five

### 1. Precision vs Recall

**Precision measures how often positive predictions are correct. Recall measures how many actual positives are successfully found.** Improving one often reduces the other.

The tradeoff depends on your application: spam filters favor precision, medical screening favors recall.

> Like a search party: you can find everyone but raise false alarms, or be very certain and miss some people.

### 2. OOD Inputs (Out-of-Distribution)

**Data that differs significantly from what the model saw during training.** Models may fail silently or produce confident but wrong answers.

Detecting OOD inputs is an active research area for safer AI deployment.

> Like asking a chef trained only in Italian food to make sushi.

### 3. Batch Size

**The number of training examples processed before updating model weights.** Larger batches can be more efficient computationally, but may generalize worse.

Finding the right batch size involves balancing speed, memory, and model quality.

> Like grading tests one at a time or waiting to grade a full stack.

### 4. Inductive Bias

**The assumptions built into a model that guide how it learns from data.** Without inductive bias, models cannot generalize beyond training examples.

CNNs assume spatial locality; transformers assume tokens can attend to any position.

> Like expecting nearby houses to have similar prices before looking at the data.

### 5. Latency vs Throughput

**Latency is how long a single request takes. Throughput is how many requests can be handled per second.** Optimizing one often comes at the expense of the other.

Batching improves throughput but increases latency for individual requests.

> Like a restaurant serving one table quickly or many tables at once.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Precision vs Recall** | Correct positives vs finding all positives |
| **OOD Inputs** | Data unlike training distribution |
| **Batch Size** | Examples per weight update |
| **Inductive Bias** | Built-in learning assumptions |
| **Latency vs Throughput** | Speed per request vs total capacity |
