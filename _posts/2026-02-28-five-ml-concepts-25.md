## Today's Five

### 1. Label Smoothing

**Replacing hard one-hot labels with softened target distributions during training.** Instead of 100% confidence in one class, distribute small probability to other classes.

Reduces overconfidence and can improve generalization.

> Like allowing small uncertainty instead of absolute certainty.

### 2. Miscalibration

**When predicted confidence does not match observed accuracy.** A model that says "90% confident" should be right 90% of the time.

Modern neural networks tend to be overconfident. Temperature scaling can help.

> Like a forecast that sounds certain but is often wrong.

### 3. Representation Learning

**Learning useful internal features automatically from raw data.** Instead of hand-crafting features, the model discovers what matters.

The foundation of deep learning's success across domains.

> Like detecting edges before recognizing full objects.

### 4. Adversarial Examples

**Inputs modified to cause incorrect predictions.** Small, often imperceptible changes can flip model outputs.

A security concern and a window into model vulnerabilities.

> Like subtle changes that fool a system without obvious differences.

### 5. Double Descent

**Test error that decreases, increases, then decreases again as model capacity grows.** The classical bias-variance tradeoff captures only the first part.

Modern overparameterized models operate in the second descent regime.

> Like getting worse before getting better---twice.
