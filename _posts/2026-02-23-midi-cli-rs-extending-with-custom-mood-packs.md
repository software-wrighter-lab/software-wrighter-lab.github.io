Personal Software doesn't stop at "it works." It evolves. After building midi-cli-rs for AI agents to generate music, I wanted more moods---without recompiling Rust every time.

The solution: a plugin system that lets anyone create custom mood packs using simple TOML files.

## The Problem with Built-in Only

The original midi-cli-rs shipped with a handful of mood presets: suspense, eerie, upbeat, calm, ambient, jazz. Useful, but limited. What if you want synthwave? Chillout? Something faster or in a different key?

Hardcoding every possible mood isn't practical. And asking users to modify Rust source code isn't friendly.

## Three Levels of Extensibility

| | Level | What You Get | What You Change | Skill Required |
|:---:|-------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| <span style="color:green">✓</span> | **Built-in Moods** | 9 curated generators | Nothing---use as-is | None |
| <span style="color:green">✓</span> | **Plugin Moods** | Parameter variations | TOML config files | Text editing |
| <span style="color:red">✗</span> | **Custom Generators** | New musical patterns | Rust source code | Programming (future) |

This post covers **Plugin Moods**---the middle tier. You can preset combinations of tempo, key, and intensity, but you're still using the built-in generators' musical logic. Want a "smooth-jazz" preset (slower, mellower)? Plugin mood. Want bebop or Latin jazz with different chord progressions? That requires a custom generator.

Custom generators (writing new Rust code) will be covered in a future post when the plugin editor ships.

## The Plugin Architecture

Custom moods live in `~/.midi-cli-rs/moods/` as TOML files. Each file is a "mood pack" that can define multiple moods. The CLI discovers them automatically.

Here's how it works:

```
~/.midi-cli-rs/
└── moods/
    ├── electronic.toml    # Your synthwave, techno, etc.
    ├── cinematic.toml     # Epic, tension, wonder
    └── seasonal.toml      # Holiday themes
```

## Creating a Mood Pack

A plug-in mood pack has two parts: pack metadata and mood definitions.

```toml
[pack]
name = "electronic"
version = "1.0.0"
author = "Your Name"
description = "Electronic music styles"

[[moods]]
name = "synthwave"
base_mood = "upbeat"
default_tempo = 118
default_key = "Am"
default_intensity = 65
description = "80s synthwave vibes"
tags = ["electronic", "retro"]

[[moods]]
name = "chillout"
base_mood = "ambient"
default_tempo = 85
default_key = "Em"
default_intensity = 40
description = "Relaxed electronic"
```

Each mood **delegates** to a built-in generator (`base_mood`) but overrides specific parameters. You get the musical logic of the built-in mood with your customizations applied.

## Available Base Moods

Your custom moods can extend any of the nine built-in generators:

| Base Mood | Character |
|-----------|-----------|
| `suspense` | Tense, building |
| `eerie` | Dark, unsettling |
| `upbeat` | Energetic, positive |
| `calm` | Peaceful, slow |
| `ambient` | Atmospheric, textural |
| `jazz` | Swing, improvisation |
| `chiptune` | 8-bit, retro gaming |
| `orchestral` | Classical instruments |
| `show` | Broadway, theatrical |

## Configuration Options

Each mood definition supports these overrides:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | CLI name (required) | `"synthwave"` |
| `base_mood` | Built-in to extend (required) | `"upbeat"` |
| `default_tempo` | BPM | `118` |
| `default_key` | Musical key | `"Am"`, `"C"`, `"Eb"` |
| `default_intensity` | 0-100 energy level | `65` |
| `description` | Human-readable description | `"80s vibes"` |
| `tags` | Discovery tags | `["electronic", "retro"]` |

## How Seeds Create Variation

Seeds aren't random---they're deterministic variation selectors. The same mood + same seed always produces identical output. But different seeds create observable musical differences across multiple dimensions:

| Parameter | Variation Range |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Tempo | ±15% from base |
| Layer inclusion | Which instruments appear |
| Melodic contour | 16 different phrase shapes |
| Note density | 0.6x to 1.4x |
| Rest probability | 0% to 35% silence |
| Phrase length | 3-8 notes |
| Velocity | -15 to +15 offset |

The system uses hash-based mixing with unique salts for each parameter. This means adjacent seeds (42 vs 43) produce completely different outputs---no gradual transitions between seeds.

When you combine plugin moods with seed variation, you get a matrix: your custom tempo/key/intensity settings applied across different seed-driven variations of the underlying generator's patterns.

## Using Custom Moods

Once your TOML file is in place, the mood appears automatically:

```bash
# List all moods (built-in + plugins)
midi-cli-rs moods

# Generate with your custom mood
midi-cli-rs preset -m synthwave -d 5 -s 42 -o output.wav
```

The seed system still works---same mood + same seed = identical output.

## Example: Electronic Pack

Here's a complete pack with four electronic moods:

```toml
[pack]
name = "electronic"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Electronic music styles"

[[moods]]
name = "synthwave"
base_mood = "upbeat"
default_tempo = 118
default_key = "Am"
default_intensity = 65

[[moods]]
name = "chillout"
base_mood = "ambient"
default_tempo = 85
default_key = "Em"
default_intensity = 40

[[moods]]
name = "techno"
base_mood = "upbeat"
default_tempo = 130
default_key = "Dm"
default_intensity = 85

[[moods]]
name = "8bit"
base_mood = "chiptune"
default_tempo = 140
default_key = "C"
default_intensity = 70
```

Drop this in `~/.midi-cli-rs/moods/electronic.toml` and you have four new moods.

## What's Next

This plugin system handles **mood variations**---different tempos, keys, and intensities applied to existing generators. A future update will add a **plugin editor** for creating entirely new musical patterns without writing Rust.

For now, the delegation model covers most use cases: want faster jazz? Darker ambient? Major-key suspense? Create a TOML file and you're done.

## The Personal Software Pattern

This follows the Personal Software philosophy: start with something that works, then extend it as needs emerge. The plugin system wasn't in the original design. It grew from actual use---wanting more moods without recompiling.

Good personal software leaves room to grow.
