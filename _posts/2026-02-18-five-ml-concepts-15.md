## Today's Five

### 1. Perplexity

**A metric for language models that reflects how well the model predicts the next token.** Lower perplexity means better predictive performance.

Perplexity is the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood per token.

> Like a test where lower scores mean you found the answers easier to guess.

### 2. Catastrophic Forgetting

**When training on new tasks causes a model to lose performance on previously learned tasks.** This is a key challenge in continual learning.

Techniques like elastic weight consolidation help preserve important weights.

> Like learning a new phone number and forgetting the old one.

### 3. Weight Initialization

**The starting values of model weights influence how well training progresses.** Poor initialization can cause vanishing or exploding gradients.

Xavier and He initialization are common strategies for setting initial weights appropriately.

> Like starting a race from a good position instead of stuck in a ditch.

### 4. Curse of Dimensionality

**In high-dimensional spaces, data becomes sparse and distances behave differently, making learning harder.** Points that seem close in low dimensions can be far apart in high dimensions.

Feature selection and dimensionality reduction help mitigate this effect.

> Like searching for a friend in a city versus across the entire universe.

### 5. Monitoring & Drift Detection

**Continuously tracking model performance and detecting shifts in input data distributions.** Production models can degrade silently without proper monitoring.

Automated alerts help catch problems before they affect users.

> Like a weather station alerting you when conditions change.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Perplexity** | How surprised the model is by the data |
| **Catastrophic Forgetting** | New learning erases old knowledge |
| **Weight Initialization** | Starting values affect training stability |
| **Curse of Dimensionality** | High dimensions make data sparse |
| **Monitoring & Drift** | Track performance and data changes |
