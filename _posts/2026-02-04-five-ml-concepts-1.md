## Today's Five

### 1. Backpropagation

**Back propagation of errors.** It's how neural networks learn---flowing error backward through the network to adjust each weight.

Without it, modern deep learning wouldn't be practical.

> Think of it like retracing your steps to see which earlier choices caused the mistake.

### 2. Transformer

**The architecture behind GPT, Claude, and most modern language models.** Instead of processing words one at a time, transformers use attention to weigh relationships between all tokens.

This enables parallel training and rich context awareness.

> Like understanding a sentence by seeing how every word relates to every other.

### 3. Mamba (State Space Models)

**A newer alternative to transformers** that processes sequences in linear time instead of quadratic.

This allows scaling to very long documents with much lower memory use.

> Like a smart conveyor belt that carries forward only what matters.

### 4. Hallucination

**When a model generates confident-sounding nonsense.** It happens because language models predict plausible next words, not true facts.

They optimize for likelihood, not correctness.

> Like a student who writes confidently without verifying sources.

### 5. Embedding

**Turning words, images, or concepts into vectors of numbers.** Similar meanings end up close together in this space.

This lets math capture semantic relationships.

> Think of it as a coordinate system for meaning.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-liner |

| **Backprop** | Learn by flowing error backward |
| **Transformer** | Attention over all tokens at once |
| **Mamba** | Linear-time sequence modeling |
| **Hallucination** | Confident nonsense from likelihood optimization |
| **Embedding** | Meaning as coordinates in vector space |
