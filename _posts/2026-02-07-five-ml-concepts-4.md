## Today's Five

### 1. Activation Functions

**Functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh that transform neuron outputs.** They introduce nonlinearity, allowing networks to learn complex patterns beyond simple linear relationships.

Without them, stacking layers would just be matrix multiplication.

> Like an on-off switch that can also dim the lights.

### 2. Transfer Learning

**Using knowledge a model learned on one task to improve performance on a related task.** This often reduces training time and data requirements dramatically.

Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific applications.

> Like a chef who already knows French cooking learning Japanese cuisine faster.

### 3. VLM (Vision-Language Models)

**Models trained to work with both images and text.** They learn shared representations that connect visual and language understanding.

CLIP, GPT-4V, and LLaVA are examples of this approach.

> Like someone who can look at a photo and describe what's happening.

### 4. Adam

**An optimizer that adapts learning rates for each parameter using information from past gradients.** It combines ideas from momentum and adaptive learning-rate methods.

One of the most popular optimizers in deep learning.

> Like a hiker who adjusts step size for each part of the trail, steep or flat.

### 5. Superposition

**A way neural networks represent many concepts using overlapping directions in the same space.** This allows models to pack more information into fewer neurons than expected.

It's why interpretability is hard---features aren't neatly separated.

> Like discovering a painting has hidden layers that appear under the right light.
