<p><em>This is the first post on Software Wrighter Lab — a blog about building small, experimental software tools, often with AI, often just for myself. No comments here; discussion happens on <a href="https://discord.gg/INVITE_CODE">Discord</a>.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Most of the software I rely on every week is software no one else will ever use.</p>

<p>It isn’t polished.
It isn’t documented.
It often isn’t even versioned properly.</p>

<p>It exists because, at some moment, I needed <em>this</em> transformation, <em>that</em> visualization, or one pipeline to run end-to-end—and then I moved on.</p>

<p>This kind of software doesn’t have a good name yet. I’m going to call it <strong>personal software</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-mean-by-personal-software">What I Mean by Personal Software</h2>

<p>Personal software has a few defining traits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is written for one person, not a market</li>
  <li>It solves a local, contextual problem</li>
  <li>It is often disposable or evolving</li>
  <li>It optimizes for time-to-utility, not longevity</li>
  <li>It may never be shared—or only shared as an example</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t a new idea.
Shell scripts, Excel macros, and one-off Python notebooks have always existed.</p>

<p>What <em>is</em> new is how cheap it has become to create these tools.</p>

<h2 id="where-ai-fits-and-where-it-doesnt">Where AI Fits (and Where It Doesn’t)</h2>

<p>AI doesn’t make personal software <em>better</em>.
It makes it <em>cheaper to attempt</em>.</p>

<p>I use AI the way I use a calculator or a shell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to scaffold</li>
  <li>to explore</li>
  <li>to reduce friction</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t need the code to be perfect.
I need it to exist <em>now</em>.</p>

<p>Many of these tools are deleted within days.
Some quietly become indispensable.</p>

<p>Both outcomes are fine.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>When the cost of writing software drops below the cost of <em>not</em> writing it, behavior changes.</p>

<p>People stop asking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is this worth building?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And start asking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What if I tried this?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That shift is more important than any specific AI model.</p>

<p><strong>I’m especially interested in:</strong> What’s the most useful piece of software you’ve ever thrown away?</p>
