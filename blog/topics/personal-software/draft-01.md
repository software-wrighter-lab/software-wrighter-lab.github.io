# Personal Software: Tools That Exist for One Afternoon

*This is the first post on Software Wrighter Lab — a blog about building small, experimental software tools, often with AI, often just for myself. No comments here; discussion happens on [Discord](https://discord.gg/INVITE_CODE).*

Most of the software I rely on every week is software no one else will ever use.

It isn't polished.
It isn't documented.
It often isn't even versioned properly.

It exists because, at some moment, I needed *this* transformation, *that* visualization, or one pipeline to run end-to-end—and then I moved on.

This kind of software doesn't have a good name yet. I'm going to call it **personal software**.

## What I Mean by Personal Software

Personal software has a few defining traits:

- It is written for one person, not a market
- It solves a local, contextual problem
- It is often disposable or evolving
- It optimizes for time-to-utility, not longevity
- It may never be shared—or only shared as an example

This isn't a new idea.
Shell scripts, Excel macros, and one-off Python notebooks have always existed.

What *is* new is how cheap it has become to create these tools.

## Where AI Fits (and Where It Doesn't)

AI doesn't make personal software *better*.
It makes it *cheaper to attempt*.

I use AI the way I use a calculator or a shell:

- to scaffold
- to explore
- to reduce friction

I don't need the code to be perfect.
I need it to exist *now*.

Many of these tools are deleted within days.
Some quietly become indispensable.

Both outcomes are fine.

## Why This Matters

When the cost of writing software drops below the cost of *not* writing it, behavior changes.

People stop asking:

> "Is this worth building?"

And start asking:

> "What if I tried this?"

That shift is more important than any specific AI model.

**I'm especially interested in:** What's the most useful piece of software you've ever thrown away?
