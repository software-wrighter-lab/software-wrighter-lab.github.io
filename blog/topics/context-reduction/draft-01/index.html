<h1 id="why-i-stopped-stuffing-context-into-prompts">Why I Stopped Stuffing Context into Prompts</h1>

<p>At some point, I realized I was spending more time managing prompts than solving problems.</p>

<p>Long prompts.
Carefully curated context.
Repeated explanations of the same structure.</p>

<p>The results weren’t getting better—just more fragile.</p>

<p>So I stopped.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-long-context">The Problem with Long Context</h2>

<p>Large context windows feel powerful, but they hide a cost:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Token usage explodes</li>
  <li>Attention is diluted</li>
  <li>Models re-derive structure they should query</li>
</ul>

<p>Long context is a blunt instrument.
It works—until it doesn’t.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-do-instead">What I Do Instead</h2>

<p>Instead of asking a model to <em>remember</em>, I ask it to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inspect files</li>
  <li>query structured data</li>
  <li>operate on graphs</li>
  <li>call tools that already know the answers</li>
</ul>

<p>This shifts work from reasoning to retrieval and execution.</p>

<p>That tradeoff is usually worth it.</p>

<h2 id="reasoning-is-expensive">Reasoning Is Expensive</h2>

<p>LLM “thinking” is not free.
It burns tokens, time, and attention.</p>

<p>If a problem can be reduced, indexed, or computed directly, I want that to happen <em>before</em> the model reasons.</p>

<p>Reasoning should be the last resort, not the first.</p>

<h2 id="where-this-leads">Where This Leads</h2>

<p>This way of working naturally leads to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>recursive reduction</li>
  <li>graph-structured state</li>
  <li>tool-first architectures</li>
</ul>

<p>Those ideas will show up repeatedly in upcoming posts and repos.</p>

<p><strong>Prompt I’m curious about:</strong> What’s the largest prompt you’ve ever regretted writing?</p>
