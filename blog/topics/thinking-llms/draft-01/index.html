<h1 id="thinking-is-expensive-when-llm-reasoning-helps-and-when-it-hurts">Thinking Is Expensive: When LLM Reasoning Helps (and When It Hurts)</h1>

<p>LLMs that “think” are often more accurate.</p>

<p>They’re also slower, more expensive, and sometimes confidently wrong in new ways.</p>

<p>So the question isn’t:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Should models think?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When is thinking actually worth it?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="when-thinking-helps">When Thinking Helps</h2>

<p>Reasoning shines when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the problem is multi-step</li>
  <li>constraints interact</li>
  <li>the solution space is small but non-obvious</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, showing intermediate steps improves correctness.</p>

<h2 id="when-thinking-hurts">When Thinking Hurts</h2>

<p>Reasoning hurts when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the task is procedural</li>
  <li>the data is already structured</li>
  <li>the answer is retrievable</li>
</ul>

<p>In those cases, thinking becomes theatrical overhead.</p>

<h2 id="my-rule-of-thumb">My Rule of Thumb</h2>

<p>I ask myself one question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can this be answered by inspecting or transforming data directly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If yes → tools first.
If no → reasoning, carefully.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>

<p>As models get faster, it’s tempting to let them reason all the time.</p>

<p>That’s a mistake.</p>

<p>The future isn’t thinking everywhere.
It’s thinking <em>where it matters</em>.</p>
